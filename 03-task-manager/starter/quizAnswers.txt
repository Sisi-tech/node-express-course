1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware refers to functions that execute during the request-response cycle. 
    They can perform various operations such as modifying the request or response objects, 
    ending the request-response cycle, or passing control to the next middleware function.
    * Application level middleware: app.use() or specific HTTP methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.delete(); 
    * Router level middleware: express.Router()

2. What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database storage system.
    1. Create: add new data to the database.
    2. Read: Retrieving or get data from the database.
    3. Update: Modifying or editing date in the database.
    4. Delete: Removing date from the database.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        a. npm install dotenv 
        b. add require('dotenv').config() on app.js 
        c. create a '.env' file and add the sensitive information with a variable name like MONDO_URL to the file 
        4. access the connections with environment variables process.env.MONGO_URI


    2.How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
        add the .env to .gitignore file to be ignored while push the updates to Github repository.
